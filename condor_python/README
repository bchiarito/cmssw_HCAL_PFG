The python event loop is in fed_plots.py. It imports detector_map_functions.py which defines mappings and it itself makes use of detector_map.dat as the raw mappings in txt format.

To run the python event loop with condor, submit a condor job, where XXXXXX is replaced with the run you want to run on:

$ condor_submit condor_runXXXXXX_makeplots.sub

then check on the condor job's status with condor_wait, where YYYYYY is replaced with whatever cluster id condor assigned to the task:

$ condor_wait -status condor_runXXXXXX_makeplots/log_YYYYYY.txt

this will report "All jobs done." where all the jobs are done.

Check the run with

$ ./run_print.sh <condor_dir>

Aggregrate the results with the included shell script

$ ./run_agregrate.sh <condor_dir> <run_number>

Clear the condor directory with

$ ./run_clear.sh <condor_dir>
