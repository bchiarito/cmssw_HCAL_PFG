The python event loop is in fed_plots.py. It imports detector_map_functions.py which defines mappings and it itself makes use of detector_map.dat as the raw mappings in txt format.

Prepartion: The files condor_runXXXXXX_makeplots.sub are the condor submission files. You will have to change two lines. First point them to a directory where the hcalntuples live, the line the begins "arguments = ". Second, change the queue number to be equal to the number of files in that directory. Make sure the names of the files are named hcalTupleTree_X.root where X starts at 0 and counts up by one.

To run the python event loop with condor, submit a condor job, where XXXXXX is replaced with the run you want to run on:

$ condor_submit condor_runXXXXXX_makeplots.sub

then check on the condor job's status with condor_wait, where YYYYYY is replaced with whatever cluster id condor assigned to the task:

$ condor_wait -status condor_runXXXXXX_makeplots/log_YYYYYY.txt

this will report "All jobs done." where all the jobs are done. Then you will need to aggregrate the results with the included shell script

$ ./agregate_runXXXXXX.sh

the result is a single filed named summed_output_runXXXXXX.root with all the plots defined in fed_plots.py using the entire run as input.
